This code generates a 3D donut shape in C++ using OpenGL. The donut is generated using a series of stacked, concentric circles.
Requirements

    A C++ compiler
    The GLUT library

Usage

To use the code, compile and run the program using a C++ compiler. The window that appears will display the donut shape. The number of slices and stacks can be adjusted by modifying the slices and stacks constants at the beginning of the code.
